# Zero-Cloud Council Prioritization Engine

This is the backend for the "Zero-Cloud Council Prioritization Engine" developed during the NVIDIA hackathon. 

The system ingests citizen reports (images) of city issues, uses a local Vision-Language Model (VLM) via Nemotron 3 Super to extract data, enriches it with local static CSV data (population density) and live API data (TfL traffic disruptions), and calculates a deterministic priority score. All AI inference runs locally without cloud APIs.

## Project Structure
- `/data/`: Contains static datasets (e.g., `density.csv`).
- `/routers/`: FastAPI endpoint definitions.
- `/services/`: Business logic for API integrations, Datastore lookup, Scoring, and local VLM execution.
- `main.py`: Application entry point.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.

## 🛠️ Environment Setup (CRITICAL)

Since we are a team of 4 sharing a DGX Spark and running heavy models like **Nemotron 3 Super**, it is **critical** to use a virtual environment. This prevents system-level package conflicts and ensures everyone is running the exact same dependency versions for PyTorch, Transformers, FastAPI, etc.

You can set up your isolated environment using either standard `venv` or `conda` (recommended for DGX).

### Option 1: Conda (Recommended for DGX)
Conda handles complex CUDA dependencies much better than standard pip.

```bash
# 1. Create a fresh conda environment
conda create -n seeit-sortit python=3.10

# 2. Activate the environment
conda activate seeit-sortit

# 3. Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Option 2: Standard Python venv
If you prefer standard python environments:

```bash
# 1. Create the virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# 2. Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🦙 Running the Local VLM (Ollama)

Before starting the API, you must ensure the local Vision-Language Model is running via Ollama. The API relies on the custom model (e.g., `my-custom-model`) served locally. 

1. Ensure Ollama is installed on your machine.
2. In a separate terminal session or screen, start the Ollama server:
   ```bash
   ollama serve
   ```
3. The server automatically binds to `http://localhost:11434`. 
   *(Note: The API is configured via the `.env` file's `VLM_API_URL` to point to this port. If the Ollama server is killed, the API will gracefully fall back to returning mock data until you restart `ollama serve`).*

## 🚀 Running the API

Once your virtual environment is active, dependencies are installed, and Ollama is running in the background, you can start the local development server:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

- The API will be available locally at `http://localhost:8000`, and to other devices on your network via your DGX Spark's IP address (e.g., `http://<YOUR_DGX_IP>:8000`).
- You can access the interactive Swagger documentation and test the `/submit-report` endpoint by visiting `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

## 🌍 Exposing the API to the Internet

If you need to access the API from outside the local network (e.g., from your phone on 5G, or sharing with teammates remotely), you can easily tunnel port 8000 to the public internet using `localtunnel` (requires Node.js `npx`).

1. Keep your `uvicorn` server running.
2. In a new terminal tab on the DGX Spark, run:
   ```bash
   npx localtunnel --port 8000
   ```
3. It will generate a public URL (e.g., `https://some-random-words.loca.lt`).
4. **Important:** When you first visit the URL in a browser, you will see a phishing protection screen. You must enter the **Endpoint IP** (the DGX Spark's external IP, e.g., `10.18.216.50`) as the password to access your server. Append `/docs` to the URL to access the Swagger UI from anywhere.

## 🧪 Testing the Endpoint
You can test the `POST /submit-report` endpoint using the FastAPI interactive docs or `curl`:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8000/submit-report' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  -F 'image=@/path/to/test_image.jpg'
```
